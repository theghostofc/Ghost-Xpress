# Ghost Xpress

## Summary
A primitive yet handy CD / DVD catalog creation tool built using **VC++ 6.0**.

## Motivation

Built when optical media was prominently stacked and used to backup and share data. And one day searching for a file was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

## Features
* Explorer-like view with familiar icons.
* A pane in the bottom right shows excerpts from files with name Serial.txt and Readme.txt. _Useful when searching for software serial keys_.
* Shows MP3 tags information _Title_ - _Album_, if present.

## Installation
* Compile the solution or simply run the exe file.
* It will create a folder _Catalog_ in the current folder.
* **Catalog will not load if it's file is renamed. Rename from the left pane of the application only.**
